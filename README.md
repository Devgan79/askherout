<h2>AskHerOut  Interactive Valentine Web Fun</h2><br>

AskHerOut is a charming, interactive web page app designed to present a personalized Valentine’s proposal (or similar greeting) with playful interactivity  where the No button moves away and the Yes button celebrates acceptance!

This project is ideal for anyone learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with real-world interactivity


<h2>Interactivity (Buttons)</h2>

<h3>NO button moves away when hovered  making it hard to click!<br></h3>

YES button is static and leads to a celebration.<br>

Envelope initially acts as a “start” screen that reveals the letter content on click.<br>

<h3>When YES is clicked:<br></h3>

Title updates to a celebratory message.<br>

Cat dance animation plays.<br>

Final text appears while buttons vanish.<br>

JavaScript binds all these interactions using event listeners in script.js.<br>
